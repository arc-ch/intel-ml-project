# üöÄAdult Income Machine Learning Project for Intel 

Welcome to the Adult Income Machine Learning Project. This project aims to analyze the Adult Census Income dataset and build a predictive model for income classification using Logistic Regression. The app also includes features for data visualization and an interactive chat interface for querying the dataset.

  ### Example Queries
  Here are some example queries you can try in the "Chat with Dataset" section:
  
  -  List the top 5 most common native countries in the dataset.
  -  What is the average age of individuals based on their marital status?
  -  Show the top 5 oldest people with Private jobs and hourly weeks equal to 35 and are female.
  -  Show the distribution of income across different races.
  -  What is the percentage of people working in state gov jobs?
  -  Compare the income distribution between all genders.
  -  Do men or women tend to work longer hours per week on average, and how does this correlate with their income levels?
  -  Show age, workclass, occupation, and income of 5 males who work for 99 hours per week.
  -  How many individuals are in each relationship category (e.g., Husband, Wife, etc.)?  
  
 ### Note:
  - You can download the query output as a CSV file by clicking on the download button on the column header.
  - You can search for specific values within the output.
  - You can sort the results by tapping on the respective column headers.


## 6. Important Notice: API and LangChain Considerations

  ### API Reliability üõ†Ô∏è
  
  The "Chat with Dataset" feature relies on the GenAI API (formerly GooglePalm), which may experience downtime or disruptions. If the API is not functioning, you can view a demo [here]
  
  ### LangChain Deprecation ‚ö†Ô∏è
  
  This application uses LangChain for integration with language models like GenAI. Please be aware that LangChain could undergo changes or be deprecated in the future. Stay updated with the [LangChain documentation](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for compatibility and support information.

  For long-term reliability:
  - Update dependencies regularly and test with the latest versions.
  - Monitor GenAI API and LangChain repositories for updates and announcements.
  - Consider implementing fallback mechanisms for continuity in case of disruptions.
